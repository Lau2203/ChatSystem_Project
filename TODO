Differentiate active users of non active users in MainWindow users panel. Indeeed, we also display the users which we had a conversation with in the past, whether these users are now active or not.

When quitting the application, we need to send in broadcast the fact that we are leaving, and in UDP listener we need to be able to interpret such signal.
